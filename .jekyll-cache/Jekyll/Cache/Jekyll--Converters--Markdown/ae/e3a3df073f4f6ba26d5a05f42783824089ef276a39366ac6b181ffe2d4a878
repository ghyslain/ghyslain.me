<p>I am an MSc. Engineering Sciences student at the Ecole Centrale Lyon in France.</p>

<p>Since June 2016, I have been assuming the position of <strong>Data Scientist Intern</strong> at InReach Ventures, a Venture Capital fund which takes a big data platform approach to discover, validate and support European deals.</p>

<p>Through the dual-degree programs offered by the Ecole Centrale Lyon, I hold a MSc in Business Analytics and Finance from the University of Southampton and a BSc in Economics and Management Sciences from the Université Lumière Lyon 2.</p>
