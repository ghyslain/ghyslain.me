# Ghyslain Gaillard.  

**Hi!** I am a Junior Data Scientist with a strong background in Engineering Sciences and based in London.  

## Quick Bio

I am an MSc. Engineering Sciences student at the Ecole Centrale Lyon in France.

Since June 2016, I have been assuming the position of **Data Scientist Intern** at InReach Ventures, a Venture Capital fund which takes a big data platform approach to discover, validate and support European deals.  

Through the dual-degree programs offered by the Ecole Centrale Lyon, I hold a MSc in Business Analytics and Finance from the University of Southampton and a BSc in Economics and Management Sciences from the Université Lumière Lyon 2.

## Education

I strongly believe that the time when Business and Engineering were at odds is over and have been eager to extend my skills to fields such as business analytics and economics.
