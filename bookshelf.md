# Machine Learning Bookshelf

**Hi!** I am a Junior Data Scientist based in London with a strong background in Engineering Sciences.
I have been self-learning Machine Learning and related skills throughout the past year, leveraging my background in Maths and Engineering Sciences.

Below, I share a list of machine learning books that are now on my bookshelf. Most of these books have a free version available on their website and can be ordered from Amazon. I have included links to relevant HN discussions, as it is how I found out about these books in most of the cases.

Have a great read,  
Ghyslain
