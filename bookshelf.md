# Machine Learning Bookshelf

Below, I share a list of interesting machine learning books I refer to for my work. Most of these books have a free version available on their website and can be ordered from Amazon. I have included links to relevant HN discussions, as it is how I found out about these books in most of the cases.

Have a great read,  
Ghyslain
