**Hi!** I am Ghyslain.

I run [Indie London](https://indieldn.com/) â€“ a series of events for entrepreneurs, developers, and bootstrappers who wish to connect, learn and share their experience of running a business.

I work full-time on the engineering team at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/) where I help transform the industry of venture capital through the development of predictive models.  

Through my work at InReach Ventures, I  have been awarded the [British Operational Research Society's May Hick Prize 2016](http://www.theorsociety.com/Pages/Awards/May.aspx) for my masters dissertation: *Predict Investment Opportunities across Early-Stage European Tech-Startups*.
