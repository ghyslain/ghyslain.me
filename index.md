**Hi!** I am a Junior Data Scientist based in London with a strong background in Engineering Sciences and a passion for entrepreneurship.

I am looking for a full-time Data Science position in London from April 2017. You can find out more about me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghyslaingaillard).

## Quick Bio

I am an MSc. Engineering Sciences student at the Ecole Centrale Lyon in France.

Since June 2016, I have been assuming the position of **Data Scientist Intern** at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/), a Venture Capital fund which takes a big data platform approach to discover, validate and support European deals.  

Through the dual-degree programs offered by the Ecole Centrale Lyon, I hold a MSc in Business Analytics and Finance from the University of Southampton and a BSc in Economics and Management Sciences from the Université Lumière Lyon 2.

## Achievements


During the Summer 2016, I developed a machine learning model that enables InReach Ventures partners to rank companies on their deal sourcing platform by the likelihood of the fund investing in them.  

The scoring system filters out irrelevant companies and make interesting start-ups stand out with high scores, thus partly-automating the work of the invesment partners.  

This Machine Learning project was part of my dissertation for my MSc. in Business Analytics and Finance at the University of Southampton, which was awarded a top-10% mark of 80/100.

Given the outstanding results of my models, InReach Ventures offered to sponsor my dissertation for my MSc. in Engineering Sciences for the Ecole Centrale Lyon. I am now working on deploying the machine learning algorithms using the distributed computing framework Apache Spark.

## Education

I strongly believe that the time when Business and Engineering were at odds is over and have been eager to extend my skills to fields such as business analytics and economics.
