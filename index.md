{:.hello}
**Hi!** I am Ghyslain

{:.center}
**I am a Senior Product Manager, with 7 years of experience building data and machine learning products for Venture Capital firms and international media brands.**

# About me

I am currently Senior Product Manager in [Schibsted](https://schibsted.com/) (Oslo, Norway) - a family of over 55+ brands, which consists of leading Nordic marketplaces and world-class media publishers.

I am leading cross-functional teams developing Schibsted's Data Platform which enables hundreds of data teams across the company to collect, distribute and manage data in their business.

Previously, I established product management at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/) (London, UK) ‚Äì a ‚Ç¨50M Venture Capital fund that builds its own proprietary software leveraging data and AI to discover and invest in the best European early-stage startups. 

Passionate about tech entrepreneurship I started [Indie London](https://www,indieldn.com/) in 2018 ‚Äì a series of events and community for entrepreneurs, developers, and bootstrappers who wish to connect, learn and share their experience of running a business. Between 2018 and 2020, I have had the pleasure to welcome in our community exceptional founders of companies such as VEED or Hopin (who respectively went on to raise hundreds of millions of dollars from the top-tier VC firms Sequoia and Accel).
