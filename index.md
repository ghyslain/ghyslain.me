**Hi!** I am a Data Scientist based in London.

I am on the engineering team at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/), where I help transform the industry of venture capital through the development of predictive models.

I hold an MSc in Engineering Sciences from the Ecole Centrale Lyon, an MSc in Business Analytics and Finance from the University of Southampton and a BSc in Economics and Management Sciences from the Université Lumière Lyon 2.

In 2017, I was awarded the [May Hick prize](http://www.theorsociety.com/Pages/Awards/May.aspx) from the British Operational Research Society for my masters dissertation.

If you would like to get in touch, please [drop me an email](mailto:ghyslain.gaillard@outlook.com) or connect on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ghyslaingaillard).
