{:.hello}
**Hi!** I am Ghyslain

{:.center}
**I am a Product Manager with 5 years of hands-on experience building data and machine learning products. I help data teams deliver value to your business.**

# About me

I am currently Product Manager in [Schibsted](https://schibsted.com/) (Oslo, Norway) building products that enable advanced collection, management and activation of our core data assets across Schibsted.

Previously, I established product management at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/) (London, UK) – a €50M Venture Capital fund that builds its own proprietary software leveraging data and AI to discover and invest in the best European early-stage startups. 

Passionate about tech entrepreneurship I started [Indie London](https://www,indieldn.com/) on the side – a series of events and community for entrepreneurs, developers, and bootstrappers who wish to connect, learn and share their experience of running a business. I moved to Oslo in 2020 and sold the community to a new owner.
