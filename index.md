**Hi!** I am Ghyslain

## About

As Data Product Manager at [InReach Ventures](http://www.inreachventures.com/), I help transform the industry of venture capital through the development of our scalable investment workflow and automated proactive outreach - leveraging data and artificial intelligence.

My passion for entrepreneurship led me to start [Indie London](https://indieldn.com/) – a series of events for entrepreneurs, developers, and bootstrappers who wish to connect, learn and share their experience of running a business.

If you would like to get in touch, we can connect on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iamghyslain), [Linkedin](https://www.Linkedin.com/in/ghyslaingaillard) or send me an email at [hi@ghyslain.me](mailto:hi@ghyslain.me)

## Indie London
#### Founder, Community Lead

**[Indie London](https://indieldn.com/)** is the largest community of indie makers helping each other start and grow profitable online businesses.

I organise quarterly events with practical and visionary talks from experienced speakers, hosting up to a 100 inspired attendees at top locations in the city.

We welcome bootstrappers, solo founders, software engineers, designers, product managers... Even if they are just starting out: we’re a community all about sharing and growing as a group.

Our previous speakers, partners and sponsors include Stripe, Cloudflare, EmailOctopus and Dependabot (now part of GitHub).
